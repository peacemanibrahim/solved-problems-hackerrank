Here is the complete logic to help anyone :

Let's take an example to undertsand the core concept behind this problem : {1, 3, 3, 9, 3, 27, 81} . 
Let common ratio = 3.

1.We will consider every element to be our middle element during our iteration. For any such element a, the number 
of possible geometric pairs possible are, no. of a/r on the left of a x no. of axr on the right of a.

2.Lets take 9 as our element. 9/3 = 3. 9x3 = 27. The number of 3s present on left of 9 are 2. The number of 27s 
present on right of 9 is 1. Hence total no. of geometric pairs possible with 9 as the middle element is 2x1 = 2. 
Do this for all the elements and add them up to get the result.

3.We create an occurence map first and call it rightMap. Now for each element, we first decrement it's count by 1 
from the rightMap. Now we check for the number of occurences of axr in the rightMap. ( Let me explain this step 
with a simple example , say the input is {1,1,1,1 } and ratio = 1, rightMap will be [1->4]. Now we need to check 
the number of times axr = 1 occurs on the right of a. We do this after decrementing the count of current value 
by 1 in the rightMap. So rightMap becomes [1->3] . 3 is the number of times aXr occurs on RHS of first 1 )

4.Now we check for a/r counts in left map. We multiply leftCount and rightCount and add them up for each element. 
The whole idea is that, for each element , leftMap contains the occurence map of the elements on the 
left of a and rightMap contains the occurence map of the elements on the right of a.
